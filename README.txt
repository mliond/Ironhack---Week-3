Day 1: We learned about CSS, cloned Google layout (really basic), learned about Bootstrap, and finally cloned a layout called 'Revera' using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
Day 2: We spent a lot of time cloning the Google Drive layout. Mine looks pretty good.
Day 3: We started with Javascript. Several small exercises to learn the basics. Afterwards we learned about callbacks and did a keynote terminal and a JSON reader called Game of Thrones Episodes.
Day 4: Learned how to adapt classes in Javascript. Did several small exercises, including a shopping cart and another Game of Rooms.
Day 5: Two big exercises. One quiz in JS, which asks the player for Europe's capitals and collects the points. Also a Twitter clone, comlpletely written in HTML + CSS + Bootstrap.
